            <section><p><strong><u>Genesis 11:1-4</u></strong></p>
            <p>1 The whole earth had the same language and vocabulary. 2 As people migrated from the east, they found a valley in the land of Shinar and settled there. 3 They said to each other, “Come, let’s make oven-fired bricks.” (They used brick for stone and asphalt for mortar.) 4 And they said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the sky. Let’s make a name for ourselves; otherwise, we will be scattered throughout the earth.” </p></section>

        <p>The people sought unity through self-glorification rather than obedience to God's commands.</p></section>

        <section><h2>The Lord Restrains Sin and Accomplishes His Will</h2></section>
        <section><p><strong><u>Genesis 11:5-9</u></strong></p>
        <p>5 Then the LORD came down to look over the city and the tower that the humans were building. 6 The LORD said, “If they have begun to do this as one people all having the same language, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. 7 Come, let’s go down there and confuse their language so that they will not understand one another’s speech.” 8 So from there the LORD scattered them throughout the earth, and they stopped building the city. 9 Therefore it is called Babylon, for there the LORD confused the language of the whole earth, and from there the LORD scattered them throughout the earth.</p></section>

        <section><h2>Reflection</h2>
        <li>Sin causes us to rebel against God’s commands.</li>
        <li>The people of Babylon chose to settle instead of spreading out, focusing on their greatness rather than God’s plan.</li>
    </section>
        <section>
            <p>How can we avoid making a name for ourselves and instead glorify God?</p>

        <h2>Gospel Connection</h2>
        <p>God scattered humanity in Genesis 11, but through Christ, He unites people from every tribe, tongue, and nation.</p>

    <section>
        <section>
            Why do you think God allowed the people to begin a tower they would not finish before scattering them as He had commanded?

            How does the church reflect true unity with diverse groups of people throughout the world?
