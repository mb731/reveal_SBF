                <section>
                     <p>While God permitted people to multiply despite their sinful nature, He preserved a righteous remnant through the line of Seth (Gen. 5). It is also important to note that God examined not only the deeds of humankind but the thoughts and attitudes of their hearts (Gen. 6:5; Heb. 4:12).</p>
